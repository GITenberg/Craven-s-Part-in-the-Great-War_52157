<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> volume of “Craven’s Part in the Great War” is a humble but
sincere expression on the part of Mr. Walter Morrison, of Malham
Tarn, of the gallant, heroic and self-sacrificing spirit shown by the
sons of Craven in resisting the unscrupulous, malignant and prearranged
design of Germany and her dupes to crush the British Empire
and the civilised countries associated with her. Mr. Morrison’s anxiety
to commemorate the part that Craven has played in the Great War, and
to perpetuate the memory of those who have fallen or been otherwise
stricken, found its solution in October, 1916, when, at a meeting at
Mr. Morrison’s “mountain home” on Malham Moor, a board of trustees to see to the carrying
out of the work was formed, consisting of Mr. Morrison (who has generously defrayed the entire
cost), Col. John Birkbeck, J.P., Settle, and Mr. Thomas Brayshaw, J.P., solicitor, Settle. The
task, which has entailed three years’ hard work in compiling what may, without egotism, be
termed a unique record, was entrusted to Mr. John T. Clayton, editor of the “<i>Craven Herald</i>,”
who has had the valued assistance of Mr. Brayshaw and his extensive local knowledge of the
Craven district.</p>

<p>Everything that assiduous care and attention to detail could suggest has been done to
make the record complete so far as the Skipton Parliamentary Division is concerned, and we are
confident that the volume will be treasured as an honoured heirloom in every family whose representative
has done his share in freeing our beloved Empire from the slavery of German hatred
and military aggression.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Few</span> people in these Islands knew in the early part of
the summer of 1914 that Europe was on the verge of
the greatest war in history. The few men who had
foresight and courage enough to warn us of the
German menace were ridiculed, and when the Archduke Franz
Ferdinand (nephew and heir to the Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria) and his wife were assassinated at Sarajevo, it was not
realized that we had reached the opening stages of a long-drawn-out
tragedy which would see Europe converted into a vast battlefield
and cast a shadow over the whole world.</p>

<p>Austria, at the instigation of Germany, made the Sarajevo
occurrence the pretext for beginning a war they had already
planned and organized. Serbia was to be made a scapegoat,
and Germany was to take advantage of the international situation
thus created to launch her schemes for empire development.
There was a month’s delay, probably to allow Germany to complete
her preparations. On July 25th, Austria sent a note to
Serbia charging her with complicity in the Sarajevo crime,
demanding the suppression of all Serbian propaganda in the
Dual Monarchy, and insisting that an investigation into the
assassinations should be conducted on Serbian soil with the
assistance of Serbian officials.</p>

<h3>GERMAN DASH TO PARIS.</h3>

<p>Serbia refused, and this was followed by a declaration on
the part of Russia that she would permit no trifling in the Balkans.
Meanwhile England was doing her utmost to pour oil on the
troubled waters. One of her suggestions was a conference.
This was turned down by Austria, who, on July 28th, declared
war on Serbia. Thus began the hostilities which led to Armageddon.
The challenge was taken up by Russia; in turn Germany
declared war on both Russia and France; and finally Great
Britain, determined not to tolerate the invasion of neutral
Belgium, and refusing to contemplate the harrying of the French
north coast, declared war on Germany. The fateful step was
taken at 11 p.m. on August 4th.</p>

<p>Germany’s preparedness for war gave her a tremendous
advantage at the outset. The first blow was aimed at Paris,
and in attempting this coup the Hun armies over-ran Belgium,
destroying and plundering some of its greatest treasures and
committing crimes which horrified the world. For a time the
advancing army was irresistible, but eventually the forces of
Sir John French and General Joffre put a stop to the enemy
progress and at the first battle of the Marne, commenced on
September 6th, caused the Germans to retreat in disorder.</p>

<p>After the first onrush had been checked trench warfare was
introduced, the line extending through Belgium, the north-east
corner of France, Lorraine and Alsace, and thence to the Swiss
frontier. Meanwhile, Lord Kitchener, realizing that the war
must of necessity be a long and exhausting one, had commenced
his great task of building up an army fit to take its stand with
those of Continental Powers. There was a noble response and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
thousands of recruits were quickly trained and drafted out to
play their part in the great adventure.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE MARNE.</h3>

<p>The relative positions of the Armies in 1915 altered little
from those taken up after the battle of the Marne, but there were
many historic events during that trying year&mdash;the capture by
the British of Neuve Chapelle, the two battles of Ypres (in the
second of which the Germans introduced poison gas), the heavy
campaigning in the Argonne, the bombardment of Rheims, the
French offensive in Champagne, and the British offensive at
Loos.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1915-1916 Germany’s initial hopes of
success began to grow less rosy. The British Army continued
to grow; Italy and Rumania joined the Allies; and on almost
every side the Central Powers began to feel pressure. The
outstanding events during this period included the smashing
by the British of an onslaught from Messines Ridge and the
repulsing of an advance towards Albert. There was terrific
fighting at Verdun (where the French displayed heroic qualities),
and the great Allied offensive on the Somme. There was also a
British victory on the Ancre, and “tanks” made their initial
appearance.</p>

<h3>ON THE WAY TO VICTORY.</h3>

<p>One of the most tragic events of the war occurred on June
5th, 1916, Lord Kitchener being drowned while on his way to
Russia. Politically there were happenings of great importance,
one of the principal being the resignation of Mr. Asquith as Prime
Minister and the acceptance of office by Mr. Lloyd George,
whose work as Minister of Munitions had brought him into
much prominence in matters relative to the conduct of the war.</p>

<p>Early in 1917 the United States, after long deliberation,
threw in her lot with the Allied cause, followed by Central and
South America. Later Greece, chiefly through the influence
of Venezelos, compelled King Constantine, the friend of Germany,
to abdicate and enter the war on the side of the Allies; while
China and Siam followed the example of Japan and protested
practically against German lust for world power. Throughout
the year there was heavy fighting on the Western front. In
April the British captured Vimy Ridge, in June they annexed
Messines Ridge, and in November took part in a magnificent
episode at Passchendaele. By these operations they became
masters of commanding positions, and for the first time the
feeling was encouraged that the Allies were on the way to victory.</p>

<h3>GERMANS’ LAST BID FOR VICTORY.</h3>

<p>One of the most noted successes in 1917 was that at Cambrai
on November 20th, while in October the French brought the
famous ridge road, the Chemin des Dames, within their lines.
“Unrestricted” U-boat warfare was commenced by the Germans
early this year, and was a source of considerable anxiety
to the Allies. Internally Russia was in the throes of revolution.
The Czar abdicated on March 15th and a republic was proclaimed
on September 15th. This was followed by the Bolshevist <i>coup
d’&eacute;tat</i> on November 8th, and an armistice on the Russian front
on December 6th.</p>

<p>The winter of 1917-1918 was in the nature of the calm which
precedes the storm. On March 21st, the Boche made his last
desperate bid for victory, attacking on a 50-mile front between
the Scarpe and the Oise. Results unlooked for by the Allies
were the outcome. Peronne was captured in three days, and
on March 25th the Germans had reached their original line of
July, 1916, on this sector. This, for the Allies, was the blackest
moment of the war, inasmuch as it brought within the range of
possibility the achievement by the enemy of his original plan&mdash;the
capture of the Channel ports and the consequent domination
of British shores.</p>

<p>The Allies prepared for a great effort. In England the
military age was raised to 51; General Foch was appointed
commander-in-chief of the Allied armies; there were effective
naval raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend; a million Americans were
shipped to France; and by the beginning of June the German
advance had been checked.</p>

<h3>THE ARMISTICE.</h3>

<p>The last German offensive began on July 15th on a 50-mile
front before Rheims. It failed and was converted into an
Allied victory. Thenceforward the Allies achieved victory after
victory. At every point the enemy was forced back, Flanders
was evacuated, a wedge was driven into the Boche line at Sedan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and along the whole line from Ostend to Switzerland the German
position was so desperate that the Kaiser, faced with disaster
in the field and naval mutiny and revolution at home, asked for
an Armistice on October 6th.</p>

<p>Austria sued for peace on October 20th and surrendered
to the Allies on November 3rd, while Turkey, having been
granted an armistice on October 30th, threw down her arms
subsequently. Following the proclamation of Bavaria as a
Republic, and the renunciation of his throne by the Duke of
Brunswick, and the suspension of payment by the Berlin banks,
the Kaiser sued for peace. On November 9th he and the Crown
Prince abdicated and the armistice terms of the Allies were
accepted by the Germans two days later.</p>

<h3>BRITISH TROOPS IN OTHER THEATRES.</h3>

<p>Apart from the operations on the Western Front British
troops figured in many historic battles in other theatres of war.
In the ill-fated expedition to Gallipoli the soldiers of the Empire
showed an undaunted spirit and came near achieving what was
regarded by many as an impossible task. Much the same spirit
under even more trying circumstances was displayed in Mesopotamia
and other parts of the Far East, as is evidenced by the
recapture of Kut and the taking of Baghdad. German influence
in far waters was destroyed by the seizure of German New
Guinea and Samoa; while a great blow to German colonization
schemes was dealt by the conquest of East Africa and the Cameroons.</p>

<h3>THE FALL OF RUSSIA.</h3>

<p>The record of Russia during the war and since provides
one of the most tragic episodes of the great struggle. One of
the first Powers to accept the challenge, Russia accomplished
much in the early days of the war on the Eastern Front, and
was of invaluable assistance to the British and French armies
by engaging the attention of large numbers of German forces.
Insidious treachery, however, brought about the downfall of
what had hitherto been regarded as a mighty empire. During
the winter of 1916-1917 the effect of this treachery began to be
felt. The civilian population had for long suffered many privations,
and the troops had been sent into battle badly armed and
insufficiently fed. Demands for representative government
were ignored by the Emperor, swayed by the pro-German
Empress, who was under the influence of the notorious monk
Rasputin. In December, 1916, the monk was murdered; on
March 15th, 1917, the Emperor abdicated and was subsequently
murdered; and the Empress and her children are said to have
shared a similar fate. A new and democratic government with
Kerensky at the head had a short reign, and ultimately, in
November, 1917, Russia, under Trotsky and Lenin, who were,
it is believed, in the pay of Germany, was given over to the
horrors of Bolshevism.</p>

<h3>THE CAMPAIGN IN ITALY.</h3>

<p>Serbia was invaded by the Austrians and Germans in
October, 1915, and the campaign was conducted by the Central
Powers with characteristic ruthlessness. Rumania fought gamely,
but eventually had to yield under the Treaty of Bucharest,
and Montenegro was also quickly disposed of. The Austrians
were thus established in Northern Albania and were led to take
up an offensive in Trentino. This was begun in May, 1916, and
honours were first with one side and then with the other until
in October, 1917, with the help of the Germans, Austria forced
the Italians to retreat to the line of the Piave. British and French
troops were sent to the assistance of Italy, and the invaders
were disastrously defeated, being swept back across the Piave.</p>

<p>The morale of the Austrian troops, except when aided by
the Germans, was never satisfactory, and the condition of her
home affairs became worse as the war progressed. The Emperor
Francis Joseph died in November, 1916, and he was succeeded
by the Emperor Karl, who was suspected of having strong
leanings in the direction of peace. The food problem in Austria
also became a very difficult one, and this, combined with industrial
and political unrest, tended to undermine the Empire’s
military efficiency until eventually the operations against Italy
came to be regarded as of secondary importance, and overtures
were made for peace.</p>

<p>The Allies recognised the Czeko-Slovaks as a separate
nation; the Croatians recognised themselves; and a promise
was made that Bohemia should be divided into national districts.
Following unsuccessful attempts to obtain peace through
President Wilson, the Austrians acknowledged the inevitable and
asked for peace on October 27th, 1918. Bulgaria had surrendered
on September 29th.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<h3>TURKISH POWER BROKEN.</h3>

<p>When war broke out the position of Turkey was an uncertain
one, but she eventually fell a victim to German machinations
and threw in her lot with the Kaiser. In the early days
she gave shelter to the runaway German cruisers, the Goeben
and the Breslau&mdash;and later both these vessels were used to bombard
Sebastopol and Theodosia. The campaign against Turkey
was in three sections&mdash;the attack on the Dardanelles, the expedition
to Mesopotamia, and the preservation of Egypt and the
advance through Palestine. Although the Dardanelles attack
was not successful and we had a set-back at Kut, the British
forces eventually broke the Turkish power in Mesopotamia and
Palestine, and on October 30th, 1918, the Turks were granted
an armistice.</p>

<h3>THE BARBARITY OF THE HUN.</h3>

<p>One of the outstanding features of the war was the ruthlessness
which marked German methods throughout. In the
invasion of Belgium and Northern France no measure was too
base to adopt in order that the spirit of the invaded countries
might be broken. Looting on the part of officers and men was
officially recognised, as also was the wholesale destruction of
property, machinery and valuable works of art.</p>

<p>Later, the barbarity of the Hun method was demonstrated
by the submarine campaign, in the course of which defenceless
merchant and passenger vessels, and even hospital ships were
“sunk at sight” and the survivors either shot or left to drown.
German warships also bombarded such “fortified” places as
Scarborough, Whitby, Lowestoft and Margate; while their
Zeppelins, and subsequently their aeroplanes, visited England
again and again, causing many casualties&mdash;a large proportion of
them women and children&mdash;in a vain endeavour to create panic
in this country.</p>

<p>Other methods by which the Germans revealed their inhumanity
in warfare included the abominable treatment of
prisoners of war; the deportation of thousands of the civilian
population of France and Belgium to serve as slaves behind the
German lines; and the execution of Nurse Cavell and Capt.
Fryatt.</p>

<h3>THE BRITISH NAVY’S GREAT WORK.</h3>

<p>The operations of the British Navy were undoubtedly one
of the dominating factors in the war. For more than four years
the silent service watched unceasingly and offered an effectual
bar to such naval enterprise as the Germans appeared capable of.
The first naval engagement was off the coast of Chili in November,
1914, in which the <i>Good Hope</i> and <i>Monmouth</i> were sunk and
Admiral Craddock lost his life.</p>

<p>This early disaster was retrieved on December 8th, when
Admiral Sturdee annihilated a German squadron under Admiral
von Spee off the Falkland Islands. For some time there was a
good deal of activity on the part of commerce raiders, principally
by the <i>Emden</i> and the <i>Appam</i>. On January 24th, 1915, there
was a naval battle off Dogger Bank in which the <i>Blucher</i> was
sunk, and six months later the <i>Konigsberg</i>, a German raider,
which had taken refuge in the Rufigi River, was destroyed by
British monitors.</p>

<p>The most serious naval engagement of the war took place
off Jutland on May 31st, 1916. This proved to be the last
attempt of the Germans to defy British sea-power. The enemy
lost eighteen ships, and the British losses were by no means light,
but the flight of the enemy fleet to the shelter of their mine fields
left no doubt as to the issue. Probably the country will never
know the extent of the navy’s work in maintaining the blockade,
safeguarding our food supply from all parts of the world, and
securing safe passage, not only for our own troops, but also for
thousands of American soldiers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most daring enterprise of the war from a naval
standpoint was the raid on Ostend on April 22nd, 1918, which
resulted in the destruction of the enemy’s submarine depots.
The last act in the naval drama was the handing over of the
German Fleet to Admiral Beatty, as part of the Armistice conditions,
and the subsequent scuttling of it by the German crews
while it was riding at anchor in Scapa Flow.</p>

<h3>THE SIGNING OF PEACE.</h3>

<p>The peace treaty was signed on Saturday, June 28th, in the
Galerie des Glaces, Versailles, by the German delegates and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
representatives of all the Allied Powers except China. The
German delegates, in a statement to the Press, declared they had
signed the Treaty without any reservations and in the honest
intention of carrying out its provisions to the best of their ability.
They hoped, however, that some of its provisions would in time
be modified.</p>

<p>The signing was received with great rejoicing throughout
Britain, a notable demonstration being made outside Buckingham
Palace, where the King, the Queen, their three sons and Princess
Mary appeared on the balcony and were enthusiastically greeted.</p>

<p>The Chinese refusal to sign was due to the fact that the
Council of Four could not see their way to reserve the question
of Shantung for future consideration instead of its being settled
as provided for in the Treaty.</p>

<p>The scene in the historic chamber was remarkable for the
absence of pomp or martial show. M. Clemenceau presided
over the formal proceedings, and with him were the French
delegation, MM. Pichon, Klotz, Tardieu and Cambon; President
Wilson and the American representatives, Mr. Lansing, Col.
House and General Bliss; the British delegation consisting of
Mr. Lloyd George, Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. A. J. Balfour, Lord
Milner and Mr. G. N. Barnes; with the following representatives
of the Empire: Canada&mdash;Sir George Foster, Mr. Doherty
and Mr. Sefton; Australia&mdash;Mr. Hughes and Sir Joseph Cook;
New Zealand&mdash;Mr. Massey; South Africa&mdash;General Botha
and General Smuts.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the signing the King issued a formal message
in which he stated that he shared the people’s joy and prayed
that the years of peace might bring to them ever-increasing
happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> these few pages it is only possible to give in the
barest outline the story of the part played by the
Craven Territorials in the great war of 1914-1919.
Time must necessarily elapse before any definitive
history can be written, when events can be critically studied and
full credit be given to all. The present sketch aims simply at
recording how men of Skipton and Keighley, of Settle and
Bingley, of Haworth, Guiseley and Barnoldswick, from the dales
of Ribble, Aire and Wharfe, from the moors of Sedbergh and
from the Forest of Bowland, left their peaceful avocations and
went to war at their country’s call, as their fore-fathers had
done before them. It will tell how their previous military
training enabled them to go overseas and bar the road to the
Channel while Britain was yet gathering her latent strength;
of how they faced the Salient in its darkest hour, and of the
parts they played in the great battle of the Somme, in the fighting
among the sand-swept dunes of Nieuport, and in the grim tragedy
of Passchendaele; and finally how, after foiling the last German
onslaught in a quick series of desperate encounters, they took
their full share in the swift, relentless attacks that ushered in the
crowning victory.</p>

<p>No space can be given to the full list of honours won; they
are already written in the official records. And when, here and
there, a few names necessarily come into the story, it must be
remembered that to every name mentioned a dozen more could
easily be added of men who deserved equally well of their
country.</p>

<h3>FROM PEACE TO WAR.</h3>

<p>On July 26th, 1914, the 6th Bn. Duke of Wellington’s Regt.
went into camp near the little village of Marske for its annual
training, and it was amid the peaceful moorlands of the Yorkshire
coast that it heard the first rumblings of the storm to come.
When the camp was suddenly broken up and the companies returned
home on the fateful first Monday of August, there was a
general feeling of tense expectation. They had not long to
wait. At 6 p.m. the following day (Tuesday, August 4th), the
orders for mobilization were issued from Skipton Drill Hall, and
the Skipton men at once began to stream in. The outlying companies
arrived during the night, and at noon next day the complete
battalion, with a heterogeneous transport commandeered
from willing neighbours, entrained for Immingham Dock under
the command of Lieut.-Col. John Birkbeck, of Settle. The
rapidity with which the change from peace to war conditions was
effected is abundant testimony to the keenness of all ranks and
to the practical character of the Territorial organization; but the
chief credit of the successful move must be given to the sleepless
labours of the three South African veterans, Capt. Sidney
Marriner (Adjutant), Lieut. John Churchman, D.C.M. (Quartermaster),
and Regimental Sergt.-Major Buckley.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<h3>COAST DEFENCE AND TRAINING.</h3>

<p>Of Immingham, the Battalion has only confused memories
of concrete floors as sleeping places, of endless tours of sentry-go,
of its first experience of strict army rations, and of countless
rumours to which unnecessary credence was given, since the
troops had not yet learnt the tainted source from which such
stories rise. Early one morning there was a particularly strong
report of a great battle in the North Sea, and an officer asked a
recruit just coming off duty if he had heard any firing in the
night. “I’m very sorry, sir, it was me!” was the unexpected
reply: “I let it off by accident.”</p>

<p>After about a week the battalion moved into billets at the
pleasant and hospitable village of Healing, near Grimsby. Here
they spent a happy and healthy month, and on Sept. 15th moved
into camp in Riby Park, about four miles further inland. The
weather was glorious and the physique of the battalion improved
out of all knowledge. Faces and arms turned brown, packs and
equipment felt lighter, and the marches over the Lincolnshire
downs insensibly grew longer. During all this time both
officers and men had been continually welcoming friends among
the new recruits who came to take the places of those unfit for
active service, under age, or whose circumstances prevented
them from volunteering for work overseas. And when a cold
wet spell at the end of October brought on a welcome move
from tents into the warmer shelter of schools and other billets
in Doncaster, it was a strong battalion of fit men, ready to go
anywhere, that marched to the station.</p>

<p>At Doncaster the battalion settled down for the winter and
made a vast number of firm friendships among the inhabitants,
who had viewed the arrival of troops with some apprehension.
The Christmas dinner, served in all the company billets, was a
huge success, though there were already many who were sore
that they were not yet in the trenches and feared that the war
would be finished without them!</p>

<p>All this time progressive training had gone on. At Healing
the battalion was alone in the village, and battalion and company
drill were the usual order of the day. Riby was a Brigade camp,
and the presence of the 4th, 5th and 7th Duke of Wellington’s
and a battery of Artillery gave an added rivalry to the quest of
military efficiency and to endurance in long marches. The
harvest was now in and field manœuvres became possible, and
the battalion received its initiation in trench digging. There was
a good deal of musketry instruction and a little firing on an indifferent
range. The signallers under Lieut. A. Slingsby and
the machine-gunners under Lieut. B. R. Brewin improved
enormously along their special lines; while the cyclists under
2nd Lieut. “Pedaller” Palmer tested their wind and muscles
up the gradients of Swallow Downs. The Brigade was inspected
at Brocklesby by Major-General Plumer, who was, in a few
months’ time, to welcome them to his own particular salient of
Ypres.</p>

<p>At Doncaster musketry practice was more seriously undertaken
and, when the Cantley ranges overflowed, parties proceeded
to all parts of Yorkshire. The field days, under the eye of
Major-Gen. Baldock, commanding the Division, with an added
force of Artillery, Royal Engineers and Divisional Cavalry, were
on a larger scale, and the continual battles of Marr and Rossington
Bridge taught officers to handle men, men to acquire something
of an eye for country, and outposts to keep alert with eye and
ear&mdash;particularly necessary if Lieut. Anthony Slingsby and his
Scouts were on the opposing side. And if the night operations
caused an annoying interference with more romantic engagements,
they taught lessons in finding the way at night that proved
valuable later on.</p>

<p>In the later stages trenches were dug, and one battalion
relieved another in their occupation by night; billeting schemes
were carried out in the surrounding villages, and the constant
alarms of raids or invasion, which on one occasion brought the
brigade scurrying back to billets from a field day, lent a feeling
of reality to the training. About the same time the Machine
Gun Section acquired for a few weeks an armoured motor-car
of enormous dimensions, with which, after spreading terror and
confusion among the children of the neighbourhood, they proceeded
to patrol the East Coast from the Humber to Flamborough
Head, to reassure the inhabitants who had been startled by the
raid on Scarborough. As a fighting machine the vehicle might be
open to criticism, but it possessed two Vickers guns and thus
enabled the section to familiarize themselves with these weapons.
It was a lucky chance, for they next met this gun when a number
were dumped upon them, without further instruction, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
unspeakable trenches of Ypres, to make of them what use they
could. The machine was finally handed over to a battalion of
desolate cyclists, who, in their overflowing gratitude, addressed
the second-lieutenant in charge as “Major” and took the whole
outfit off his thankful hands without a murmur.</p>

<p>In December, 1914, the battalion had been reorganized upon
a four-company, instead of the old eight-company system. The
two Skipton companies (A and B) became A company: the two
Keighley companies (D and E) became D company: Guiseley
and Settle (C and F) united to form the new C company, and
Bingley and Haworth (G and H) became B company. About
the same time the cyclists left the battalion to form part of the
new divisional cycling company. The battalion had got nicely
settled into its new dispositions when in April it received the long
deferred order to go overseas.</p>

<h3>IN THE FRONT LINE.</h3>

<p>The first portion of the battalion, consisting of the Transport
and Machine Gun section, left Doncaster on the night of April
12th, 1915, and crossed from Southampton to Havre on the
night of 13/14th April. The remainder of the battalion crossed
by a more direct route to Boulogne on the following day, and
after a long and weary march joined the same train at Hesdigneul
on the 15th. The re-united battalion travelled on by the
sleepy little branch line through Lumbres to St. Omer and then
forward to Merville where they detrained at 11-30 p.m. After
unloading horses, mules and waggons, the whole battalion set
off on a three-mile march to Neuf Berquin. What with the
darkness and the unfamiliar language, the task of billeting was no
easy one, but all the men were got under shelter before dawn
and enjoyed a well-earned repose in their first French billets.</p>

<p>The names of the officers who went overseas with the
battalion, noting the casualties which occurred among them,
may be given here as some indication of the severe fighting
through which the battalion passed. Many of the officers given
as wounded were hit more than once: and the casualties among
the other ranks were in much the same proportion:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. J. Birkbeck, of Settle, commanding officer;
Major C. P. Cass, of Keighley, second in command; Adjutant,
Capt. S. F. Marriner. Company commanders&mdash;Major C. M.
Bateman (wounded) (A), Capt. A. B. Clarkson (wounded) (B)
Capt. N. B. Chaffers (C) and Capt. T. K. Wright (D), with
Capt. H. Dixon, Capt. C. H. Sarsby (wounded), Capt. E. G.
Whittaker and Capt. K. Nicholson as their respective seconds-in-command.
The platoon officers were Lieuts. M. Law (killed),
Supple (killed), H. Knowles (killed), C. H. Petty (wounded),
C. Horsfall (killed), 2nd Lieuts. F. L. Smith (wounded), K.
Ogston (killed), V. W. Greaves, T. S. Whitaker (killed), L.
Jaques (wounded), N. Geldard (wounded), R. C. Barrett, T.
Brayshaw (wounded) and Stuck (wounded). The quarter-master
was Lieut. J. Churchman, D.C.M; Signalling officer,
Lieut. A. Slingsby (killed); Transport officer, Lieut. S. H.
Clough (wounded); Machine Gun officer, 2nd Lieut. R. M.
Robinson, and Medical Officer, Lieut. A. C. Haddow (wounded).</p>

<p>2nd Lieut. G. Buxton (wounded) and 2nd Lieut. Coulthurst
(killed), who were on the sick list at the time, followed
the battalion a few weeks later, and Capt. M. Wright, who was
left behind to organize a nucleus company to provide reinforcements,
himself came out with a draft during the early autumn.</p>

<p>Major General Baldock was in command of the Division
and Brig.-General E. F. Brereton of the brigade.</p>

<p>Arrived at Neuf Berquin the 6th Duke’s was not allowed to
remain idle. After three days’ rest the battalion was taken up by
detachments for trial trips to the trenches and on April 26th the
brigade took over from the London Regiment a portion of the
line in front of Fleurbaix. It was at this time that the First West
Riding Division became the 49th; the 2nd West Riding Brigade,
consisting of the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Duke of Wellington’s
Regiments, became the 147th Infantry Brigade, the whole being
attached to the Indian Corps in the First Army.</p>

<p>In after days men commonly looked back on the Fleurbaix
era as a time of peace and plenty. It is true that the weather
was good and the life not too strenuous. But the sniping was
unusually severe. Few reliefs took place without a casualty
and the shelling of billets was a far from comfortable novelty.
The way the battalion settled down to work in its new surroundings
augured well for the future.</p>

<p>On May 9th the men were spectators of one of those early
attacks which cost so much and gained so little. The limit of
the main attack was the right of the 6th Battalion; and if it had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
been successful the battalion was also to advance and take a
part. But backed by insufficient artillery and faced by relentless
machine gun fire, the attack failed to reach the foot of the Aubers
Ridge, and the battalion was ordered to stand fast in its trenches.
It was a day of tense anxiety and the battalion was lucky to have
so few casualties. The signallers especially distinguished themselves,
mending the lines back to the brigade as soon as they
were cut by shellfire; and few will forget the picture of Lieut.
Anthony Slingsby striding upright across the open, while he
sternly commanded some diminutive signaller beside him to
“keep his head down.”</p>

<p>Quieter days followed, and on June 26th the brigade left
those trenches for the last time, handing them over to their
gallant fellow-territorials of the 51st Division. The battalion
was no longer raw: it had seen its dead. One officer (Lieut.
Knowles) had been killed in a bombing accident, and two
(Lieut. Petty and Capt. Sarsby) had been severely wounded.
About twenty other ranks were among the casualties. And the
old grey walls of the ruined abbey, with its little fishpond and
the stately remnants of its tower, will always be remembered by
those who helped to defend it.</p>

<h3>THE YPRES SALIENT IN 1915.</h3>

<p>On leaving Fleurbaix the 147th Brigade moved north by
rapid marches, and soon the whole Division found itself in the
Second Army under Major-General Plumer. The last march,
from the neighbourhood of Meteren to St. Jans-ter-biezen Wood,
was particularly severe for troops that had just come out of
trenches. It was a good fifteen-miles tramp over rough and
hilly roads: it was undertaken at night when most men had
been on their legs all day, and everyone had to carry all his belongings
on his back. When the battalion finally halted in its
allotted position in the wood, the men had no difficulty in
sleeping where they lay.</p>

<p>Here the battalion bivouacked for a week and underwent
inspection by various generals, renewing their acquaintance with
the Army commander. On July 7th they moved forward and
for the first time entered the never-to-be-forgotten salient of
Ypres.</p>

<p>Northward from Ypres runs the Yser canal, and in insecure
shelters scratched into the embankments the support battalions
had their home. The bridges crossing the canal were enfiladed
by the enemy’s machine guns and were constantly destroyed by
shell fire: and the rain of shrapnel whistling through the distorted
trees caused men moving up either bank to dodge like
rabbits from shelter to shelter. But this was a haven of rest
compared to the front line. In front of the canal was sheer
desolation, with ridges sloping upwards towards the enemy.
Wet weather turned the whole country into a quagmire and
many were drowned in the mud. Across this waste stretched
the trenches, formed of sandbagged breastworks, with arms and
legs of dead Frenchmen projecting from them at intervals. The
enemy was too close for rebuilding. The line was curiously
irregular, as one side or the other had bitten off a piece of the
opposing defences, and at more than one place our men were
only fifteen yards from the enemy. In some parts the bombing
was worst, in others the trench mortars, and in others again the
shells: but none were healthy and all smelt abominably. As
for retaliation, a few rounds of shrapnel were all the ammunition
our artillery could spare in those early days. No regular division
had stopped in the line for more than six weeks, even in summer,
and the West Ridings looked hopefully forward to an early move.
They held that line against shelling and gas, in deepening mud
and rising water, for six long months.</p>

<p>The 49th Division had a stormy welcome. In the first
few days the Divisional commander, Major-General Baldock,
was wounded by shrapnel at the door of Trois Tours Chateau,
and was succeeded by Major-General Perceval; and a shell
through his bedroom caused Brig.-General Brereton to leave
his cottage for safer quarters. Before the 6th Battalion had
finished its first turn in the line it had grievous losses to deplore.
Among them the gallant Lieut. Slingsby had been killed by a
sniper; Lieut. Supple mortally wounded by a shell, and 2nd
Lieuts. Jaques and Brayshaw severely wounded. It was then,
too, that Pte. Bracewell, a stretcher bearer, himself wounded,
won the first D.C.M. for the battalion.</p>

<p>As the autumn wore on and worse conditions supervened,
the battalion still stuck to its work, making its regular trips to
the front line and always leaving behind some of the best of comrades.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
At the end of October, Lieut.-Col. Birkbeck, who had
already suffered from rheumatism, was invalided home. Of the
battalion commanders who had come out with the Brigade he
was the last remaining, and there was general regret that he had
not had the chance of leading the battalion in open warfare in
which he had trained them and for which his experience of
African campaigns had peculiarly adapted him. “Honest
John” the men called him, and they were all sorry to lose one
who had always given them fair play. Major Bateman had
already been wounded and Lieut.-Col. J. Adlercron, of the
Cameron Highlanders, took over the command.</p>

<p>The men took a little time to understand their new commander
and he probably thought them a queer lot. But his
wide military knowledge, his boundless energy, and, above all, his
absolute fearlessness, soon won their admiration and respect
and established a satisfactory mutual understanding that lasted
throughout his command. It has been said of some leaders that
they never sent their men where they would not go themselves;
if Col. Adlercron sent men to a particularly nasty post he would
commonly go twenty yards further himself and inspect the
enemy’s wire in front of them.</p>

<p>Conditions grew steadily worse. “Trench foot” made its
appearance among the troops, and though many precautions were
taken there was much painful suffering. The mud difficulty
and the fall of the leaves made the work of the Transport increasingly
arduous, and Lieut. Churchman’s stores at Hospital
Farm became a favourite target for shells from either side of the
salient. The death of Lieut. T. S. Whitaker, always most
cheery when times were worst, was a serious loss to C company.
But through it all the spirits of the battalion never flagged.
Sergt. Bury, with a few fellow bombers, was holding a peculiarly
noisome forward post within bombing range of the enemy when
he received word that he was to go on leave. He protested indignantly.
“Who’s to look after my sap?” he cried. And
it was only when Lieut. F. L. Smith promised to give the sap
his own special attention that the sergeant, with some misgiving,
consented to return for five days to civilization. And a like
feeling animated all.</p>

<p>At this time the ⅙th Duke’s had the French as their next-door
neighbours, and at the bridge over the Yperlys stream,
where the two Armies met, an international post was established,
consisting of an officer and a few men from each army, specially
selected for their knowledge of their allies’ language.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT GAS ATTACK.</h3>

<p>On December 19th, in the darkness of the early winter’s
morning, the Germans made another desperate attempt upon the
line after discharging the deadly phosgene gas from cylinders.
It was the strongest concentration of gas sent over by the enemy
during the war: the ground over which the cloud passed was
covered with powdered crystals like hoar frost, and Canadians
on parade at Bailleul, twelve miles back, felt the effects. The
4th Duke of Wellington’s was in the front line, the 6th had B
company and the machine gunners on the Canal Bank and the
remainder in ruined farms a short distance behind. At 6-30 a.m.
the battalion received orders to move forward through the clouds
of gas to support the 4th. All reached their positions in perfect
order and the men of the 4th were astonished at the speed with
which the much-needed succour had reached them. The
Germans, though they inflicted heavy losses on the 147th Brigade,
reaped no tactical advantage from the outrage. The 6th had
many casualties both from gas and shelling. The machine
gunners, worn out by a particularly arduous time in the line,
suffered very heavily, and among the eight who succumbed to
gas was that excellent soldier Lance-Cpl. J. W. Willan, of
Skipton, who had refused a commission elsewhere to serve in
the ranks of the 6th.</p>

<p>The battalion, sadly reduced in numbers, had a last turn
in the line and lost 2nd Lieut. T. Carson, mortally wounded on
patrol, and Lieut. Malcolm Law, an admirable bombing officer,
who was killed in the act of handing over to the incoming division.</p>

<p>Getting clear of the line by dawn on the last day of the year,
the battalion, now little more than 200 strong, travelled by motor-bus
to the neighbourhood of Herzeele and Wormhoudt for a
month’s rest and reorganization. The Machine Gun Corps had
recently been formed as a separate arm of the service, and the
machine gunners under Sergts. J. Watson and F. Stork, who had
both done sterling work for the battalion, were transferred to the
brigade company under the new corps. At the beginning of
February, 1916, the battalion moved by train to the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of Amiens. It was a welcome change and the clean fields
and green hills were a grateful sight to Craven eyes after the
shellmarked flatness of the Salient. Though the Division was
by no means up to strength it had temporarily to take over the
line at Authuille, north of Albert, during a snowy spell at the
end of the month. The share of the 6th Battalion was limited
to two or three unpleasant days. Water up to the knees was no
novelty, but the men have vivid recollections of some lively
trench-mortaring, and of the droves of enormous rats that
scampered over the snow at night like flocks of sheep.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME.</h3>

<p>The great attack on the Somme had already been planned,
and the 6th Duke’s were engaged for some months in digging
assembly trenches, laying railway tracks, carrying material to
the line, and generally assisting in the many preparations that
had now become recognised as necessary to a successful offensive.
They were quartered at different times in most of the villages
from Toutencourt to the river Ancre, and in April and May
went farther back to the pleasant village of Naours lying in a
beautiful valley north of Amiens. Here vigorous training was
carried on for the coming offensive, and replicas of the famous
Thiepval defences were constructed and successfully attacked.</p>

<p>Conditions were now growing better. Expeditionary Force
Canteens had come into being; Y.M.C.A. huts at times were
encountered; organized entertainments were given. The
general standard of living was much improved and wire beds
were occasionally found in billets. The old days of scarceness
had passed, and “rest areas” had become more worthy of the
name and were visited with greater regularity.</p>

<p>But before the battle opened another change came in the
command of the battalion. Lieut.-Col. Adlercron, D.S.O.,
received well-deserved promotion to the command of the 148th
Brigade (in the same division), and Major C. M. Bateman, D.S.O.,
was appointed Lieut.-Colonel in his place. No more popular
choice could have been made. Colonel Bateman had commanded
the headquarters detachment of the Craven territorials for many
years before the war and had already won golden opinions in
France both as company commander and as second-in-command.
Always cool in danger, and naturally endowed with a fine military
judgment, he had a special asset in his intimate knowledge of his
men, who would have followed him anywhere.</p>

<p>The great battle of the Somme, which was to last into
November, opened at 7-30 a.m. on July 1st, 1916. On this day
the 49th acted as reserve to two other Divisions in the 10th Corps,
ready to exploit any success that might be won. The roar of
the bombardment had been heard for some days and shells were
singing overhead on the evening of June 30th as the 6th Battalion
moved up from Warloy into the assembly trenches it had previously
dug in Aveluy Wood. At 7-25 a.m. the trenches rocked
as the mammoth mine went up at Beaumont Hamel. The
roar of the heavies ceased for a moment, giving place to the
rattle of machine guns as the British went over the top, to be
succeeded by a terrific drumfire from the 18-pounders and
French 75’s whose shells came swishing over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>Though the attack had been a success to the south, it made
little headway against the powerful fortresses of Thiepval and
Beaumont Hamel. The battalion crossed the river without
loss and spent the night in the Crucifix dug-outs near Aveluy
village. Next afternoon it received hurried orders to move to
Thiepval Wood, prepared to attack at dawn next morning. It
was an unpleasant march up the river valley, for this provided
the only cover behind the line and the enemy’s artillery were
giving it particular attention. At the North Bluff, Capt. Haddow,
the popular medical officer, was wounded by a shell with some of
D company, and Cpl. E. Briggs was killed while bringing up
machine gun ammunition. In Thiepval Wood, reached in the
darkness, there was little shelter and the battalion spent the
night under heavy shelling and machine gun fire. What had
been in the evening luxuriant woodland was found in the morning
to resemble a group of clothes props. The attack, however, was
postponed, and the battalion returned for a night of thunderstorms
into Aveluy Wood. Next day it moved forward again
and took over the line immediately facing Thiepval with headquarters
at Johnson’s Post. Here the Brigade remained for forty-eight
days, never moving further back than the support positions,
some 800 yards from the German line. The trenches had been
practically obliterated and had to be re-dug in close proximity
to the enemy; there were many bodies to bury during the short
hours of darkness, and rations and water were brought up with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
difficulty. In the first twenty-four hours the battalion, without
making any attack, suffered over sixty casualties, and losses continued
daily. At times the battalion had to make “Chinese
attacks,” feints to hold the reserves opposite in their positions
while other divisions were attacking to the south, and also threw
out smoke bombs to obscure from the view of the Germans in
Thiepval the flanking movement against them. This always
drew a heavy bombardment. Meanwhile a good line was dug,
and saps were pushed forward ever nearer to the doomed fortress.</p>

<p>At last towards the end of August the battalion moved out
to Lealvillers for a week’s rest. Here Captain N. B. Chaffers,
M.C., who had been adjutant since December, 1915, when
Capt. Marriner had been promoted to a staff appointment, left
the battalion to become second in command of the 3rd Worcesters.
He was succeeded by Capt. F. L. Smith, M.C., who had won a
great reputation as a company commander. Lieut. Robinson,
whose notes on Lewis gun tactics, originally written for the
6th Battalion, had been adopted for use throughout the British
Army, was ordered to G.H.Q., where he spent more than a year
working at the organization of Lewis gun training before returning
to the battalion.</p>

<p>In less than a week the battalion was back in the Thiepval
area, but it did not take any active part in the attack on Sept. 3rd,
in which the 49th Division was engaged. The 6th was in support,
and suffered losses from shell-fire; Lieut. Gill was killed,
Lieut. Jaques badly wounded, and a dug-out occupied by A
company was knocked in. The 147th Brigade managed after
heavy losses to capture most of their first objective, but their
neighbours on either side made no headway and the attack was
abandoned before the 6th was drawn in.</p>

<p>After ten days’ rest the battalion again returned near Thiepval,
but this time it faced the village from the ridge to the south,
instead of looking up at it from the valley to the west. The
West Ridings were now in the old German lines in the “Leipzig
salient,” which had been penetrated on July 1st, and occupied
an extremely strong system of enemy trenches known as the
“Wunderwerk” for the astonishing character of the defences.
Though much damaged by our shells, the deep dug-outs and
tunnels still remained to show how the enemy had been able to
hang on in Thiepval through all our bombardments. From
these lines the Division slowly crept forward, one battalion
snatching a length of German trench one night and another the
next. The 6th had to pay dearly for their successes. One
night Capt. Cedric Horsfall was shot while making a reconnaissance
in front of the line, and his death was a sad blow to all the
battalion. As strong as a horse and a glutton for work, he was
always ready to lend a hand with pick and shovel, and on a long
march might be seen striding along carrying a couple of rifles
for two of his weaker brethren. His shrewd leadership and unfailing
kindness had endeared him to all ranks. Another gallant
officer to fall was Lieut. W. B. Naylor, who was acting as Brigade
bombing officer, and among other losses were Sergt. Marks, an
excellent N.C.O., and Private Bottomley, whose unfailing
humour had lightened many dark days for his comrades. Lieut.
Clegg, who afterwards greatly distinguished himself with the
Independent Air Force that bombed the German towns, was
severely wounded.</p>

<p>After an attack in this sector a curious adventure occurred
to that cheerful fighter, Sergt. Cecil Rhodes. Seeing a waterproof
sheet stretched out upon the ground he stooped to pick
it up, when to his surprise an unwounded German sprang from
under it and bolted. The sergeant gave chase and soon had
his man a prisoner.</p>

<p>The battalion was beginning to penetrate the inner defences
of Thiepval when it was relieved by the 18th Division, who,
with the assistance of tanks, finished off the task.</p>

<p>During September the battalion was sorry to lose its very
popular Brigadier, Brig.-General E. F. Brereton, C.B., D.S.O.,
who had commanded them since the days of peace. When he
returned home, Brig.-General L. G. Lewes, D.S.O., of the
Essex Regt., took his place.</p>

<p>On leaving Thiepval the battalion at once marched northwards
and took over the line near Fonquevillers, facing the
German stronghold of Gommecourt, and for the remainder of the
winter kept moving on from one bad line of trenches to another,
working hard to drain and improve them for the benefit of their
successors. At Fonquevillers the trench-mortaring was very
heavy, and four N.C.O.’s in D Coy. were killed one night by
a single shell. Here too 2nd Lieut. Wilson was mortally wounded
by a chance bullet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>Shortly before Christmas the 6th moved out to rest at the
little villages of Halloy and Grenas, near Doullens, and though
the billets were not of the best the Duke’s were able to eat a good
Christmas dinner without interruption from the enemy.</p>

<p>Early in the New Year, still moving slowly northwards towards
Arras, the battalion went into a new line near Berles-au-Bois
and then at last found some really good trenches in the solid
chalk of Wailly. During this winter the game of “winkling”
had come into vogue. The line on both sides was commonly
held by detached posts, and small parties of resolute men would
stalk one of these, surprise the sentry and then pick prisoners
out of the dug-out behind him as one picks winkles out of
shells. The 6th were never “winkled,” though they had to
keep very alert, but at Wailly a small party of D Coy., headed by
Sergt. Bury, D.C.M., took a hand in the game with great success.
Raiding an enemy sap they inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.
Pte. Scott, of Keighley, had the misfortune to lose his way when
the signal was given to return and was captured. After being
severely cross-questioned, about an hour later he took advantage
of a moment’s inattention on the part of his captors and escaped
back to his own lines with some useful information about the
enemy’s dispositions. A raid on a grand scale was then planned
and practised, but the battalion was again moved on before it
could be brought off.</p>

<h3>FROM NEUVE CHAPELLE TO NIEUPORT.</h3>

<p>The next move was to a different area. The ⅙th (as it
must now be called) was packed on to the railway at Doullens
and, after a lapse of two eventful years, once again detrained at
Merville, which it found in deep snow. The following day it
moved into trenches at Neuve Chapelle. The historic redoubt
of “Port Arthur,” so hotly contested in 1915, was in the battalion
sector, and the famous La Bass&eacute;e road ran through it. The
Duke’s had an enormous stretch of line to look after and held
it lightly in the outpost system; but, except for the trench
mortars, which the enemy possessed in great numbers, their
stay here was not an unpleasant one and they remained in the
line for nearly three months.</p>

<p>At the end of March a raid was carried out by the battalion.
The operation was carefully practised and on the night of March
28-29 the raiding party set off under the command of Capt.
S. H. Clough, who was the first man to enter the enemy’s lines
and the last to leave them. Strong opposition was encountered
and no prisoners could be taken, but all ranks behaved with
great gallantry. Capt. Clough and Lieut. J. W. Denison (afterwards
killed while serving with the 9th Batt.) were both wounded;
and 2nd Lieut. Butler and Pte. Pickup, D.C.M., were killed in
the operation.</p>

<p>Two interesting events occurred during the stay at Neuve
Chapelle. One was a visit from a special company of Royal
Engineers, armed with a number of the new gas projectors,
which discharged many large gas shells simultaneously into the
enemy’s lines. To the great delight of the men, who remembered
their own experiences at Ypres, from 200 to 300 of these shells
were concentrated upon one sector of the enemy’s line and
caused serious losses to the Germans. The other was the arrival
of the 1st Portuguese Division which first came into the line in
small parties to learn the art of war from the 49th, and finally,
towards the end of May, took over the line from them.</p>

<p>After their long spell of trench work the battalion thoroughly
enjoyed a fortnight’s rest at the aptly named village of Paradis.
The quarters were excellent, and it was here that an officer of
the battalion made his name famous throughout the B. E. F. by
discovering a particular variety of billet. Brigade sports and
a horse show were organized, in which the battalion more than
held its own. In the latter it swept the board in the heavy
draught section: and in the former it won the tug-of-war, and,
largely thanks to the fine running of Pte. Carter, also did well in
the field events. From Paradis the men could clearly hear the
terrific shelling of the battle of Messines, when the new “creeping
barrage,” employed thereafter with such great success, was first
brought to perfection by our artillery.</p>

<p>The 147th Brigade was next lent for a fortnight to the 6th
Division, old friends of the Salient days, to take the place of a
brigade required elsewhere. The ⅙th Duke’s took over a
sector opposite the famous quarries of Hulluch, towards the
northern end of the battlefield of Loos. The defences occupied
were of a remarkable character, for vast underground tunnels,
large enough to take a battalion, stretched all along the line. In
these secure quarters, fitted with electric light and other conveniences,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the bulk of the troops passed the day. But on the
surface the sniping was keen and the trench mortars, hidden in
deep emplacements, were exceptionally active. 2nd Lieut.
Darragh, a most intrepid officer who had lost two brothers earlier
in the year, was wounded and died a few days later; and Sergt.
Bell, of Haworth, was killed, again one of three gallant brothers
who lost their lives for their country. In this sector, too, the
battalion was called upon to assist an extensive raid carried out
by the battalion on their right. A magnificent smoke screen was
put up to hide the preliminary preparations from the enemy in
Hulluch, while a plucky party under 2nd Lieut. J. S. Spencer
created a spectacular diversion by exploding a Bangalore torpedo
right under the German wire.</p>

<p>From Hulluch the ⅙th Battalion moved at once into quite
a new type of country, for in the middle of July the Craven men
found themselves encamped on the sandy dunes east of Dunkirk
on the Channel Coast. Originally sent north to take part in a
contemplated attack, they found on arrival that the situation
had entirely changed. The Germans had clearly got wind of
the affair, and, concentrating much heavy artillery and an unexpected
division of sailors, had broken through the British
lines, reaching the banks of the Yser from its mouth nearly to
Nieuport and seriously threatening the important crossings about
that town. To the 49th Division once again fell the r&ocirc;le of
Salvation Army and they threw themselves vigorously into their
work, relieving the battered troops in front, straightening out the
line and remaking the defences. The sector taken over by the
⅙th Duke’s was the ruined village of Lombaertzyde, immediately
in front of Nieuport. Of trench system in the ordinary
sense of the term they found none, and sheltered solely by hollows
in the shifting sand they had to face continual bombardment.
Here the ⅙th first made the acquaintance of shells filled with
mustard gas, which caused most painful blisters to many of the
men. To reach the front line was a matter of great danger and
difficulty. The direct route, through the town of Nieuport, was
always heavily shelled, and the three bridges across the river
Yser were continually knocked in. Apart from the shelling
these bridges were something of an obstacle. Formed of wooden
frames filled with cork and lashed together they sagged greatly
at low tide and the roadway stood at an alarming angle to the
bank. Many gallant deeds were performed by the 49th Division
during their stay, but none was more dashing and dangerous
than the raid carried out by the ⅙th Duke’s on a pitch dark
August night. Since the German attack no prisoners had been
taken, and the higher command was anxious to know what
forces the enemy had in the line against us. In this object the
raid was a complete success. Led by that amiable desperado,
Capt. Godfrey Buxton, a strong party of D company entered
the enemy’s trenches. When the alarm was given the Germans
laid down a terrific barrage on our lines and the ground in front,
and there was general anxiety as to the safety of the raiders.
Their return shortly after with five prisoners and a machine gun
aroused great enthusiasm. In this raid Capt. Buxton, Corporal
Driver and Private Bibby particularly distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>On August 17th the battalion was withdrawn for a very
welcome month’s rest at Coxyde Bains and La Panne, two
watering-places much favoured by wealthy Belgians in time of
peace. At Coxyde Bains the men were quartered in empty
villas and thoroughly enjoyed the experience; and the sea
bathing was much appreciated, in spite of numerous casualties
from small stinging jelly fish. The enormous shells of “Big
Bertha,” the German long range gun, used to hum past on their
way to Dunkirk, and their bombing planes sailed overhead most
nights, but neither interfered seriously with the seaside holiday.</p>

<p>Here the Battalion lost the very valuable services of Regt.
Sergt.-Major O. Buckley, M.C., who received a commission as
quarter-master of the ⅐th Duke’s. He was succeeded by
Coy. Sergt.-Major T. Richardson, D.C.M., who had come out
as a sergt. with the battalion.</p>

<h3>PASSCHENDAELE.</h3>

<p>Leaving La Panne on Sept. 23rd, 1917, the battalion
spent the next ten days in a most enjoyable march. Trekking by
easy stages through rich agricultural country in perfect harvest
weather, the men usually found good billets and good fare.
St. Omer was passed on the 30th and on Oct. 3rd the battalion
found itself once more near Poperinghe on the threshold of the
Salient. The following day the battalion set off for the line and
had a long and trying march. Moving from Poperinghe to
Vlamertinghe in the morning, later in the day they again pushed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
on across the Canal and bivouacked at what had once been Spree
farm, where the road came to an end in swamps that could only
be crossed on duckboards. Next day they took over the line
north of Zonnebeke from the New Zealanders.</p>

<p>The advance associated with the name of Passchendaele
had been begun most successfully in July and August, when
British troops under Major-General Rawlinson, with Belgians
on their left, had attacked from the old trenches by the Yser
canal and gained possession of the lower spurs in front of them.
To complete the mastery of the topmost ridge the attack was
continued through the autumn, when rain had turned the whole
country into swamp. How far this perseverance and the enormous
loss of life it entailed were justified by the military exigencies
it must be left to later historians to decide, but certainly the
conditions of the front line were not fully realised by commanders
behind.</p>

<p>The high ground that separates Ypres from the main plain
of Belgium resembles an enormous sponge. Even in hot summer
weather bogs and ponds are found upon its summit, while
numerous swampy streamlets wander down its sides. In
October many stretches were impassable except by wooden
tracks laid on brushwood which were only constructed with the
greatest danger and difficulty. Bombarded for three and a
half long years, over all this huge area the shell-craters nearly
touched each other. Whole villages were entirely wiped out;
of fine chateaux not a trace remained; roads were completely
obliterated; and wide woodlands were only marked by misshapen
stumps two or three feet high. With the enemy on
higher ground, all preparations and movements of troops for
an attack had to be made in the darkness, and a single false step
off the prepared track meant loss of life or guns or rations.</p>

<p>Right in the centre of this desolation the ⅙th held the
line for six days, soaked with rain, standing in water and suffering
all kinds of discomfort, yet only two men went sick. A great
attack had been planned for October 9th in which the ⅙th
Batt. was to support the 146th (West Yorks.) Brigade. Late in
the night a battery commander arrived at the battalion headquarters
dead beat. Moving at all possible speed he had only
just reached his position and half his guns had been bogged on
the way; and many infantry battalions, picking their way
through bottomless swamps in the dark, were quite unable to
reach their jumping-off lines at the allotted time. Under such
circumstances a sweeping success was impossible; many gallant
deeds were done, a few pill-boxes were taken, and a party under
Captain Buxton, M.C., seized and held some valuable ground;
but it is doubtful if the results of the day were worth the very
heavy price. The ⅙th was relieved by the Canadians the
following day, and on coming out was highly congratulated by
the Army and Corps commanders on the part it had played.
Whatever may be the military verdict on the Passchendaele
battle, it is certain that no other incident in the war tested so
thoroughly the grit and fighting qualities of the British soldier
and no victories were won in the face of greater difficulties;
the ⅙th Duke of Wellington’s is justly proud of having taken
a worthy part in this struggle.</p>

<p>The battalion went out for a short rest in the neighbourhood
of Winnezeele and during this period Major-General E. M. Perceval,
C.B., D.S.O., relinquished the command of the Division, which
he had held for over three years and returned home to command
the 68th Division on the East Coast. He was succeeded by
Major-General N. J. G. Cameron, C.B., D.S.O., of the Cameron
Highlanders. General Perceval had been very popular throughout
the Division, but like General Baldock before him he was a
gunner, and the infantry thought it only fair that an infantryman
had now been selected for the command.</p>

<p>A fortnight later the battalion returned to the very tip of
the salient. This time its line lay more to the south where the
summit ridge had already been captured: and from their
trenches at Broodseinde could look far down into the Belgian
plain. The approaches again were very difficult and the men
had to lay some miles of duckboards in the deep mud before
they could be said to possess any communications at all. Soon
after going in, the battalion lost a very promising young officer
in 2nd Lieut. Rupert Atkinson, of Settle.</p>

<p>Christmas was spent in these desolate surroundings; the
battalion was in the front line on that festive day, standing in
deep mud and subsisting on such rations as had not been bogged
on the long journey from Belgian Battery Corner. On Boxing
Day the battalion had to deplore the loss of Sergeant Cecil
Rhodes, M.M., who was killed by a shell. In the very early
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
days he had made a great reputation as a fearless bomber; always
cheerful himself, his gift of humour in the most disheartening
circumstances was a real asset to the battalion, and
he had won the lasting affection of both officers and men.</p>

<h3>THE LAST YEAR.</h3>

<p>Relieved early in January by the 66th Division, the battalion
was employed for nearly a month in constructing a reserve line
on Westhock Ridge, a couple of miles in front of Ypres; but in
January moved back to billets in Hondeghem, near Hazebrouck.
Here, in February, the battalion had its Christmas dinner.
There was one large room in the village and there each company
in turn was regaled on beef and Yorkshire pudding, pork, cold
ham, Christmas pudding and other seasonable fare. About a
fortnight was spent at Hondeghem, companies going in rotation
to Moulle, near St. Omer, for musketry practice.</p>

<p>At this time it was decided to reduce the number of battalions
in an infantry brigade from four to three throughout the
British army; as a result many battalions were disbanded and
their men sent as drafts to other units. The ⅙th Duke of
Wellington’s received about a dozen officers and 300 men from
the 5th and 8th battalions of the Duke’s, and were thus brought
up to strength.</p>

<p>In the middle of February the battalion was back again in
the salient, taking over the Polygon Wood sector with headquarters
in the conspicuous mound known as the Butte, one of
the few recognizable landmarks in the area. The New Zealanders,
whom the battalion relieved, had worked hard at the
line and bequeathed to our men quite a respectable line of
trenches and a light railway running to within 300 yards of
battalion headquarters. In doing this they had suffered heavily,
and a subaltern was commanding their brigade; but the ⅙th
was very grateful for the shelter afforded, for the shelling all
round was fierce and the German artillery had got a very accurate
range on all the tracks. There was a good deal of raiding at
this time and the battalion had to repulse two attempts upon
their lines; they were also spectators of a most successful raid
carried out by the 4th Duke’s at Polderhoek.</p>

<p>In this neighbourhood the battalion had three tours of duty
in the front line and then moved back to Reninghelst, a village
a short distance south of the Ypres-Poperinghe main road.</p>

<h3>STEMMING THE GERMAN ONSLAUGHT.</h3>

<p>The Duke’s had already heard the news of the desperate
German onslaught on the Somme where much ground had been
lost by the Third and Fifth Armies, and as they marched to
Reninghelst the rumbling of artillery could be clearly heard
from the direction of Armentieres, which lay only some ten
miles to the south, on the far side of the ridge running from
Mont des Cats to Kemmel Hill and dividing the plain of Ypres
from France. But no news of any offensive in that area had
reached them, and the men took off their clothes and went to
bed in comfort for the first time for several weeks.</p>

<p>But the battalion was not to enjoy an undisturbed night.
Shortly after midnight (April 9-10) everyone was awakened and
dressed hurriedly. Ammunition was made up to fighting scale,
Lewis guns taken off the limbers, and two days’ rations served
out. By 2 a.m. the battalion was on the road in motor buses.
Crossing the ridge they descended at Trois Rois cross roads,
north of the town of Nieppe, where the whole of the 147th
Brigade (&frac14;th, ⅙th and ⅐th Duke of Wellington’s) was
concentrated. After a hasty breakfast the whole Brigade moved
forward across the open fields and took up a line in front of the
town of Nieppe, facing Armentieres and astride the main road
leading from that city to St. Omer and the Channel ports. After
working some hours on defences, at 1 p.m. bullets began to
enfilade the line from the south, and the brigade fell back a short
distance to an old trench line from which they could more securely
watch the threatened flank.</p>

<p>Only now did the battalion learn more or less what had
happened. On the morning of the 9th after a heavy bombardment
the Germans had attacked and driven back the Portuguese,
who were still holding the Neuve-Chapelle-Fleurbaix sector;
following up their success they had crossed the river Lys near
Bac St. Maur and had thus turned the flank of this valuable line
of defence. When the 6th Battalion took up its line at Nieppe,
the Germans were at no great distance from their right flank
and later in the day captured Steenwerck, which was actually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
behind them. So far as was known a British division still held
Armentieres but they were weak in numbers and hard pressed.
The task of the 147th Brigade was therefore twofold: (1) to
check any advance of new German forces from Armentieres;
and (2) to prevent the enemy from continuing his enveloping
movement from the south and capturing the valuable line of
hills behind them.</p>

<p>The battalion remained in its new line all night, on the
extreme right of the Brigade. Troops kept coming back from
Armentieres and it was impossible to know whether there was
any continuous line in front. Next morning the question was
answered, for the Germans were in close touch all along our
front and the trenches were subjected to a terrific machine gun
fire. A German aeroplane which came over dropping stickbombs
was successfully brought down; a few minutes later one of our
planes was also brought down close behind the 6th, but luckily
the pilot and observer escaped little hurt into the West Riding
trenches. The position of the brigade was now a difficult one
for the enemy was behind them on either flank&mdash;at Neuve
Eglise to the north and at Steenwerck to the south&mdash;and their
line was assuming a horseshoe shape. C company, on the extreme
right, found Germans advancing against them up a trench
leading into their own. Lieut.-Col. Bateman, D.S.O., who
was making one of his frequent tours of inspection, at once
gathered a small party of B and C Coy. men with a few machine
gunners, and himself led a very successful little charge, accompanied
by Captain Ogston, Lieut. Baker and 2nd Lieut. Whitehead.
Many Germans were killed and one prisoner was taken.
The ⅙th still stuck to their ground and barred the main road,
till at 7 p.m. the order came to retire. It was none too soon,
for the leading company had to bayonet Germans on the road
behind them, and Very lights from either side were falling in
their path. Passing through another division which was to
take up the task of defence, the battalion moved to La Creche
and bivouacked.</p>

<p>At noon next day they were roused by shelling and at once
moved out to take up a new line a short distance in front of the
town of Bailleul. During this advance A Coy. had to drive off
a party of some thirty Germans with machine guns. In their
new line they were attacked next day from two sides; the 7th
battalion facing down the Armentieres road while the 6th faced
south. C company, of the 6th, holding the angle, bore the
brunt of the attack and inflicted heavy losses on the baffled
enemy, but they suffered a serious loss in the death of the gallant
Capt. K. Ogston, who had commanded them for many months.</p>

<p>Early next morning (April 14th) another retirement was
ordered and the brigade fell back to a line on the outskirts of
Bailleul. The Germans continued their usual programme&mdash;a
bombardment at 1-30 p.m. followed by an attack from 3 p.m.
till dark, and once again were driven off with great loss. During
this attack the British right flank was in the air, and a party of
Germans getting round it made straight for 6th Battalion headquarters.
They were soon driven off with considerable loss by
Lieut.-Col. Bateman, Lieut. A. S. Stewart and Regt. Sergeant-Major
Richardson, with the officers’ servants and orderly room
staff. On this day, too, Sergeant Whiteley, the medical sergeant,
cycled to Steenmill, a mile to the south, to fetch dressings from
the transport, which had been there the previous day. He
found it occupied by Germans and had some difficulty in escaping,
leaving his bicycle in their hands.</p>

<p>That night the brigade was relieved by another division and,
retiring behind Bailleul, thought that their troubles were ended.
But the following day’s attack was too much for the troops in
front, who retired, and the 6th Battalion had to dig yet another
line. On the 17th a fresh attack by strong forces was repulsed
and in a gallant counter-attack A company, under Major
Tanner, captured three machine guns and a few prisoners.</p>

<p>The following evening the brigade was relieved and retired
slowly to reorganise in Poperinghe.</p>

<p>After three quiet days the battalion passed a disturbed
night on the 24th-25th April. Heavy shelling began about teatime,
several billets being hit, while all night long the town was
bombed with gas bombs by relays of aeroplanes. One fell right
on the stores and inflicted serious casualties, and several of the
transport were killed and wounded in stables near by. But at
mid-day on the 25th, the ⅙th was once more moving forward.
Kemmel Hill, lately taken over by the French, had been surprised
in the early morning mist and captured, and upon the new line
running through Millekruise (which the 147th brigade now took
over from the battered 9th division) the safety of Ypres lay.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Digging their line under continual shell fire the battalion was
not attacked till the 29th, when the Germans made desperate
efforts to break the whole line from Dranoutre to Voormezeele.
The shelling, mostly from big guns, lasted incessantly from 3
a.m. till 4 p.m. and was the heaviest ever experienced by the
battalion. In the attack that followed, the enemy forced their
way into the lines of the 7th battalion on the left and had to be
driven out by bayonet charges; but the 6th had forward posts
commanding the valley in front and with accurate Lewis gun
and rifle fire stopped the attackers dead as they descended the
lower slopes of Kemmel Hill. The German onslaught had
been stemmed, and the ⅙th Duke of Wellington’s, relieved by
the 39th French Division, retired to rest at Reninghelst, the
village from which it had started on its eventful journey twenty-four
days before.</p>

<p>During all these operations the ⅙th had never once been
driven back by the enemy. All the retirements were made
under orders from the higher command and were carried out
without confusion; enormous losses had been inflicted on the
enemy; and the whole brigade admitted that Lieut.-Col.
Bateman had been the life and soul of the defence. But a sadly
heavy toll had been paid for success. Besides Capt. Ogston, the
battalion had to mourn many of its best fighters who had come
out in the early days. Among these were Lieut. Norman
Procter, M.C., who, after a long spell of sterling work as battalion
signalling officer, had been promoted to the Brigade staff: Sergt.
Bury, D.C.M., M.M., who had signally distinguished himself
in many a hard fight: Sergt. Gibson, D.C.M., Sergt. Burrows
and Sergt. Stott, of Skipton; Sergt. Harding, M.M. of Keighley,
Corporal Tillotson, M.M., of Oxenhope, and Corporal Barton,
M.M. of Hellifield, an admirable Lewis gun instructor. D
company had also lost their devoted commander, Capt. Buxton,
M.C., who was very seriously wounded.</p>

<p>The whole Division was now withdrawn from the line and
spent some weeks in the neighbourhood of Proven and St.
Jans-ter-biezen, resting, reorganizing, training, and working on
reserve lines. It was at this time that the 147th Brigade started
its own particular concert party, “The Ducks,” which became
very popular. The general manager was Lieut. J. S. Spencer,
of Keighley, while Private Morgan, of B company, with his
wonderful soprano voice, made up into one of the most attractive
“leading ladies” in France.</p>

<h3>THE GARRISON OF YPRES.</h3>

<p>At the beginning of June the 49th Division once again
staked out its claim to the proud title of “Garrison of Ypres” by
returning to the line in front of that city. The trenches had now
drawn very close to the town and battalion headquarters were
often in the ancient ramparts. An attack was confidently expected
and the order was that Ypres was to be “held at all costs.”
However for some reason the attack never came off. Delayed
by an epidemic of influenza, it was probably finally abandoned
owing to the need of troops to meet Marshal Foch in the south.
Here the battalion remained for the summer. Heavily shelled
with gas on its first arrival, its stay on the whole was not an unpleasant
one, in spite of shelling both on the front line and back
areas, and constant visits from bombing aeroplanes.</p>

<p>The Belgians were on the left and their soldiers created a
very favourable impression. Later the 1st American Division
arrived and came into the trenches with the ⅙th Battalion for
instruction, before taking over the line themselves in the latter
half of August. They appeared to be excellent material, and
were very eager to learn all they could.</p>

<p>The outstanding feature of the stay was a very successful
raid undertaken one morning by a party of A company under
Lieut. C. Lowther, M.C. and Lieut. Farrer. Many Germans
were killed and four captured. The following day Company
Sergt.-Major Wiseman, D.C.M., led another successful foray,
inflicting casualties on the enemy.</p>

<p>The ⅙th Duke’s left Ypres for the last time on August
19th, and with the rest of the Division had gone back to a delightful
rest area between Calais and St. Omer. They had just
settled down to training in charming surroundings when they
were suddenly ordered to move south. The First Army had
begun its final offensive and the 49th was required to take a
part.</p>

<h3>THE ADVANCE FROM CAMBRAI.</h3>

<p>After brief halts at Pierremont (near St. Pol), at Estrees-Cauchie,
and at Ecurie, the battalion arrived on September
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
23rd, 1918, at Wilderness Camp, about two miles from Arras
on the Cambrai road. During this period Brig.-General C. G.
Lewes, C.M.G., D.S.O., was transferred to home service, and
Brig.-General Morant, D.S.O., of the Durham Light Infantry,
was promoted to the command of the 147th Infantry Brigade.
At Wilderness Camp other changes occurred within the battalion.
Major Tanner, after a long spell of arduous work with the 6th
Battalion, returned to his original battalion (7th Duke’s) as
second-in-command: and Major Hugh Dixon, who had made
a great reputation both as a skilled instructor and a cheerful and
tenacious leader, left the battalion on promotion to be second-in-command
of the 9th Essex Regt.</p>

<p>Here the battalion remained a fortnight while the situation
developed. The attack, as yet, had only been pushed forward
south of the river Scarpe, and the Germans were known to have
reserves in Douai, to the northward, which might be used against
the flank of our advance. But on October 6th the order was
given to move forward; the north was now secure. On the 9th,
when Cambrai was captured, the 6th were close behind, and
on the 10th moved up to Escadoeuvres in front of that city, and
were in close support to the front line. The following day they
were once again at grips with the enemy.</p>

<p>The southern half of the First British Army (south of the
Scarpe) was at this time far in advance of the northern half, and
the plan was formed to push forward by surprise attacks towards
Valenciennes on the south, in order to cut off the German forces
who were known to be holding out in the strongly defended
neighbourhood of Douai.</p>

<p>For this difficult and hazardous task the 49th Division was
selected. If a surprise was to be effected, no time was permissible
in which to move up a full complement of artillery, and
it was with a scattered barrage of 18-pounders that the 49th
went over the top, over ground which they had had no time to
reconnoitre.</p>

<p>The 146th Brigade (West Yorks.) was on the left and the
147th (Duke of Wellington’s) on the right. The 6th Duke’s,
in support to the 4th and 7th Duke’s, moved out of Escadoeuvres
at 11-45 p.m. on the night of Oct. 10-11th and dug in near the
village of Naves. Advancing at dawn through the German
barrage of gas shells they crossed the Erclin river without incident:
but near the top of the ridge beyond found the front line
coming back and themselves met with heavy machine gun fire.
They were soon mingled with the front line on the top of the
ridge and there saw four enemy tanks advancing through the
division, causing many casualties. Lieut. H. Hopwood, with
Corporal Ames and a party of D company Lewis gunners,
opened concentrated fire upon the leading tank and caused them
all to retire. The ridge was held, but the Division had suffered
heavy casualties. The 6th, who had suffered less than some
others, had lost three company commanders&mdash;Capt. Coulthurst,
killed, and Capt. Clifford and Lieut. Grey wounded.</p>

<p>This line was occupied for the night. By next morning
the enemy had retired, and the ⅙th led the way forward through
the village of Villers-en-Cauchies without interference except
from the machine guns of enemy aeroplanes. The next opposition
was encountered at Saulzoir, on the Selle river, which was
found to be strongly held. By vigorous patrolling the battalion
gradually pushed their way into the village, where they found
many civilians in cellars, who welcomed them affectionately
and fed them with coffee, though themselves suffering severely
from the enemy’s mustard gas. A large number of French
civilians were removed to safety by night. By these advances,
in which Lieut. Hopwood, M.C., Lieut. Farrar, 2nd Lieut.
Bilham, Sergts. Best, M.M., Green, D.C.M., Calvert, D.C.M.,
Sykes, D.C.M., and Rosenthal, D.C.M., in turn did valuable
work, the battalion had fought its way house by house practically
up to the Selle river, where it was relieved on the night of October
18th by the 2nd Battalion Duke of Wellington’s Regt., among
whom the 6th Battalion found many friends.</p>

<p>In the week’s fighting the battalion had lost heavily. Besides
Capt. Coulthurst, 2nd Lieut. Ricroft, a most promising young
officer, had been killed; also Company Sergt.-Major McDermott,
D.C.M., one of the best N.C.O.’s the battalion ever turned out;
Sergts. Godwin, M.M. and Midgley, M.M., Corporals Haw
and Stanley, and many other good fellows. On the night before
the relief, a gas shell, falling on the roof of the cellar which served
as orderly room, placed almost all our battalion headquarters
hors-de-combat. Lieut.-Col. C. M. Bateman, D.S.O., with
Lieuts. Stewart and Thrackray, was taken to hospital; Lieut.
A. P. Smith, M.C., the Acting Adjutant, left alone in the cellar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
was just able to hold on and give the necessary instructions before
he, too, had to be helped out of the line. Major A. B.
Clarkson, M.C., took over the command of the battalion and
Major F. L. Smith, M.C., who had been attached to the Divisional
Staff, returned as second-in-command, with Lieut. A. Lacy as
adjutant.</p>

<h3>THE FINAL VICTORY.</h3>

<p>After a short rest at Naves and Hordain the Battalion found
itself again in the battle line on the night of Oct. 28th-29th, when
it took over the front near Famars, south of Valenciennes. The
floods to the west and north of Valenciennes prevented a direct
attack upon that city; and the task set the 49th Division with
Canadians on their left and the 4th Division on their right, was
to break through the strong series of defences on the hills and
valleys to the south and so render the city untenable.</p>

<p>The 49th Division attacked on a two battalion front. To
the ⅙th Duke of Wellington’s was assigned the honour of
leading the attack on the right, with the 7th Duke’s in support
and the 4th Duke’s in reserve. The 146th (West Yorks.) Brigade
attacked on the left in similar formation, and the 148th was held
in reserve for a further push northwards the following day.
Within the ⅙th Batt. A and B companies had to attack first;
their task was to rush the German first line and the posts in
front of it, descend into the valley, cross the river Rhonelle and
ascend the opposite slope as far as a deeply sunken road on the
next ridge. C and D companies were then to push through
them and if possible reach the line of the Preseau-Marly road
some 800 yards beyond. The whole arrangements were most
carefully worked out and explained by Lieut.-Col. Clarkson,
M.C., and a splendid supporting barrage was organized by
Colonel Duncan, of Otley, who was in command of the artillery
brigade covering the ⅙th front and had one 18-pounder gun
for every twelve and a half yards of frontage, without counting
those of heavier calibre behind.</p>

<p>The attack, which opened at 5-15 a.m. was a most successful
one. The men were delighted to start a clean show of their
own, planned by their own officers, instead of their usual task
of going in to retrieve the fortunes of a day of failure: though
they numbered little over 320, they captured about 600 unwounded
prisoners (including twelve officers), a great store of
machine guns and trench mortars, and left many hundred German
dead upon the field.</p>

<p>A company on the left, under Capt. Farrar, M.C.,
went off with a rare dash and rushed a number of hidden machine
gun posts found unexpectedly near their line; crossing the
Rhonelle river by fallen trees and by footbridges placed in
position by parties of the 19th Lancashire Fusiliers, they accomplished
their task in spite of severe casualties, and came unexpectedly
upon the sunken road, which was found full of surrendering
Germans and of pack-horses which had just come up
with their rations. B company on the right had an even
stiffer time; all their officers had been put out of action within
five minutes of the start, and flanking machine gun fire raked
them all the way. Company Sergt.-Major T. Limmer, D.C.M.,
at once took charge and led the company with the greatest skill
and gallantry to its objective, thus winning the only M.C.
awarded to a Company Sergeant.-Major of the battalion during
the campaign.</p>

<p>After a short pause C company, under Lieut. W. Spratt,
M.C., who had taken command in place of Capt. Willink,
wounded, moved forward from the sunken road and after stubborn
fighting reached their furthest objective. D company
under Capt. Hart, M.C., attacked on their right but soon suffered
very heavy casualties, for the 4th Division, on their right again,
had met with a severe check and had been driven back from
Preseau. At the critical moment Capt. Hart and practically
all his head-quarters staff were killed by a burst of machine gun
fire, and the company was forced to dig in a few hundred yards
short of their objective. As the West Yorks. were also unable
to get quite to their objective, this isolated Lieut. Spratt, who
was still holding his ground with Sergt. Woodhead, M.M.,
Sergt. Burns, M.M., Corporal Maude, M.M., and a handful of
other stalwarts; and Lieut.-Col. Clarkson, who managed to
visit the whole front line during the hottest fighting, ordered
him to retire a short distance to make the line more secure. But
the high ridge had been won and the enemy was forced to retire
from his cunningly constructed defences. The 7th Battalion
advanced next day with very little opposition and Valenciennes
was restored to France.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>The battalion had lost a big proportion of its small numbers.
Besides Capt. Hart, M.C., 2nd Lieuts. Cartwright and Oughton
had been killed and Capt. Willink succumbed to his wounds a
few days later. Sergts. Upton and Davies and Corporal Maude,
M.M., all of whom had done gallant work, were also among the
fallen. Lieut. Claridge had been wounded shortly before the
battle, and Sergt. Fredericksen, M.M., commanded the signallers
most successfully throughout the attack.</p>

<p>On the night of November 2nd, the Battalion moved out of
the line for what proved to be the last time. Taken in motor
‘buses back to the mining village of Auby, near Douai, they were
engaged in reorganizing and training new drafts when news of
the Armistice arrived. There was little material for any form of
feasting, but a most successful concert was held and the Battalion
store of S.O.S. rockets and flares was found to be lamentably
deficient next morning.</p>

<p>There was plenty of good fare for the Christmas dinner, for
which four live pigs were obtained, regardless of expense, from
the other side of Arras. And shortly after, while football and
education became main topics of interest, the battalion began
to dwindle. Demobilized men began to go home and retainable
men and volunteers were transferred to the 13th Battalion Duke
of Wellington’s Regt. at Dunkirk. The numbers were already
very small when the battalion moved into the city of Douai, on
March 20th, and on June 7th, the cadre, consisting of four
officers and twenty-three other ranks, left for Dunkirk, with
colours and stores, on its homeward way.</p>

<p>On June 16th, Lieut.-Col. Bateman, D.S.O., who had returned
to the Battalion early in the year, crossed the Channel
with his small party, and on June 19th the cadre enjoyed a civic
reception from the town of Skipton, before depositing in the
ancient parish church the regimental colours, which had been
taken to France after the Armistice. Later in the day the cadre,
with Lieut.-Col. Birkbeck, Major Clarkson, D.S.O., M.C., and
a number of other returned officers, was entertained at a late
luncheon by the Skipton Urban District Council, with Councillor
John Walker in the chair.</p>

<h3>THE STORES AND TRANSPORT.</h3>

<p>In this narrative of the fighting there has been little opportunity
to do full justice to the stiff work gallantly done by the
Transport Section and by the band of handy men collected under
the Quartermaster’s command and commonly known as “the
Stores.” Upon their efforts the comfort, well-being, and
general fighting efficiency of a battalion in the field largely
depend, and in the case of the ⅙th the companies in the line
never lacked their hearty support.</p>

<p>When the cadre returned to Skipton it was only fitting that
one of the officers to carry the colours should be Capt. John
Churchman, D.C.M., for he holds a truly remarkable record.
When he went to France he was by many years the oldest officer
in the battalion, yet till the cadre was finally dispersed at Ripon,
except for terms of short leave, he had never been off duty for a
day. To him the battalion owes a deep debt of gratitude. He
was well supported by Quartermaster-Sergt. Norton, M.S.M.,
who, coming to France with the 147th Brigade headquarters, rejoined
the 6th in the early days at Ypres and also remained
throughout the war. Much valuable work along various lines
was also done by Corporal Ward, Corporal Aspinal, Lance-Corporal
Jenkinson, Privates Newhouse, Walker and Maudsley
in the Ration Dept.; Shoemaker-Sergt. Bulcock and Corporal
Busfield (tailor) in the Repairs Dept.</p>

<p>The Transport section, ever most cheery when work was
hardest, was given a good start by Capt. S. H. Clough, M.C.,
who took them to France and only left them on getting command
of his company after a strenuous winter in the muddy salient.
Lieut. Morgan Bevan had charge for a time and was then succeeded
by Lieut. C. M. Perfect, who led them gallantly through
the bad times of Passchendaele and the fighting round Bailleul.
When he returned home after an accident, he was followed by
Lieut. Sidebotham. But all would willingly acknowledge how
much they owed to Sergt. Field, M.M., M.S.M., the transport
sergeant. Sergt. Bryden, M.M., early distinguished himself,
and with that genial giant, Corporal Kay, M.M., Privates
Howard and Williamson, and a few more, was very prominent
in the difficult nightly marches to the Broodseinde ridge with
pack horses, when shells fell thickly all round and a single step
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
off the narrow wooden track spelled disaster. In the desperate
fighting at Nieppe, the 6th Batt. transport alone was able to get
through the shell-swept street of the town and kept its record
for always taking rations to the line. To the men of the Transport,
too, belongs the main credit for a wonderful performance
at Merville Station, when the whole battalion, complete with
horses, mules, waggons, cookers, watercarts and everything else,
was loaded on a train ready to start eighteen minutes after entering
the station yard. Their genial kindliness always attracted to
their lines a curious and devoted collection of stray dogs, goats,
and children, and they will always be affectionately remembered
by “the lads” in the companies, for whom they would always
willingly undertake the most hazardous journey.</p>

<p>Of the Medical Section, largely recruited from the
Barnoldswick branch of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, it
need only be said that it played a prominent part in every action
that has been mentioned, and the long list of honours that fell
to its share is ample testimony to the excellence of its work.
The standard set up by Capt. Haddow and Sergt. Garrett,
D.C.M., in the early days was maintained throughout. When
Capt. Haddow was wounded at the opening of the battle of the
Somme, he was succeeded by Capt. Glover, who did admirable
work through the Thiepval fighting, but was recalled soon after
to an important post at home. For the remainder of the war
the battalion enjoyed the valuable services of Capt. S. P. Stoker,
M.C., who set his men a constant example of cheeriness and
kindheartedness through the many dark days that followed.
In addition to his skill as a doctor and assiduity as sanitary
inspector he possessed distinct gifts as an after-dinner speaker,
and when, after the Armistice, he was transferred to the Army
of the Rhine, he took with him the good wishes of all ranks in
his old battalion.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Perhaps</span> one of the most poignant tragedies of the
early stages of the War was the sinking of the hospital
ship “<i>Rohilla</i>” on the East coast near Whitby. It
was a disaster which will long be remembered by
the Craven district generally and Barnoldswick in particular,
inasmuch as the splendidly appointed ship of 7,000 tons
had on board fifteen Barnoldswick members of the Naval Sick
Berth Reserve. Of these only three were saved, the remainder
being reported dead or missing.</p>

<p>The “<i>Rohilla</i>” was on her way to Dunkirk to bring back
the wounded, and at ten minutes to four on the morning of
October 30th, 1914, she struck on submerged rocks in the
vicinity of Whitby. Within half a mile of land she broke in
two, and was battered to pieces in the presence of thousands of
spectators, who, for the most part, were helpless. The dangerous
proximity of the vessel to land was first noticed by a sentry on
night duty on the pier head at Whitby, who was astonished to
see a large vessel loom up out of the darkness and pass silently
within a few yards of the pier.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously a coastguard sighted the vessel and
recognised her peril as she skirted the submerged rocks which
stretch from the foot of the south cliff. Half a mile further on,
within a few hundred yards of a curious promontory known as
Saltwick Nab, the vessel struck the rocks with a grinding crash.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Rockets were at once sent up and the alarm raised. The vessel
was about 500 yards from the cliff and in as helpless a position
for rescue as could be imagined. It was impossible to launch
the larger of the two lifeboats from Whitby Harbour or to drag
it under the lee of the cliffs to a more favourable position, and
all attempts of the Rocket Brigade to establish communication
with the vessel were unavailing.</p>

<p>The smaller lifeboat was, however, dragged along the beach
towards Saltwick Nab and a favourable position found for
launching. Meanwhile one of the “<i>Rohilla’s</i>” boats had been
lowered, and after a severe buffeting, reached the shore with the
second officer and five of the crew. The rescue of the remainder
seemed assured as the boat had brought a line from the steamer,
but to the dismay of the onlookers this snapped before any use
could be made of it.</p>

<p>Then an attempt was made with the lesser of the Whitby
lifeboats. In spite of the very heavy sea they reached the
wreck, and, thanks to the admirable seamanship of the coxswain,
took off seventeen of the survivors, including the whole of the
women on board&mdash;five. In this boat were Privates Rediough
and Waterworth. A second trip was made and eighteen more
were rescued and safely landed, but the boat was found to have
been so battered by the double journey as to render her unseaworthy,
and further attempts were impossible.</p>

<p>Word was sent for the Upgang lifeboat, but before this
arrived it was clear the “<i>Rohilla</i>” was breaking up. About
10 a.m. an unusually large wave swept the wreck and when the
foam had cleared away it was seen that the stern had turned
turtle, and there was no trace of a number of men who, a few
minutes before, had been clinging to that portion of the ship.
The bows were also settling down and all the men left alive on
the vessel were clustered on the bridge.</p>

<p>The Upgang lifeboat, which had been dragged through the
town, was lowered over the cliffs, but it was then deemed impossible
to launch her. Darkness fell at 5 o’clock. It was a
night of horror. Saturday morning saw the superstructure of
the “<i>Rohilla</i>” still above water with its tragic load. Attempts
were made by several&mdash;among them, it subsequently transpired,
one or two of the Barnoldswick men&mdash;to swim ashore, but few
succeeded. An attempt by the Upgang lifeboat to reach the
wreck failed, and the continued inability of the Rocket Brigade
to do anything effective was most disheartening.</p>

<p>When it drew towards evening on Saturday scarcely a
flicker of hope remained. About 10 p.m., however, a message
was sent to Capt. Neillson urging him to hold on till morning,
news having come through that the Tynemouth motor lifeboat
was coming down the coast during the night and would attempt
a rescue the following morning. Oil was poured on the water
near the wreck. The motor boat arrived in the early hours and
stayed in Whitby harbour until dawn, when it made towards
the wreck. Amid scenes that will never be forgotten by those
watching from the beach, all the survivors were taken off and
landed safely. Pte. Eastwood was the only Barnoldswick man
to be taken off in the motor boat; Pte. Waterworth and
Pte. Rediough had previously been taken ashore by the Whitby
lifeboat.</p>

<p>There were few towns more sad than Barnoldswick when the
news of the disaster came through. Flags were hoisted half
mast on the public buildings, feeling references were made from
the pulpits of the town, an impressive memorial service was
held, and letters of sympathy received from the Admiralty, the
Medical Department of the Admiralty, and from many ambulance
divisions and brigades in Yorkshire and Lancashire. A
fund was started for the erection of a memorial hall, but this has
since been merged in the Barnoldswick War Memorial.</p>

<p>A handsome monument has been erected in Whitby Cemetery
by the owners of the “<i>Rohilla</i>” (the British India Steam
Navigation Co.). As the outcome of the disaster a movement
for equipping Whitby with a motor lifeboat has been successfully
carried through, with the assistance of the Royal Lifeboat
Institution. The new boat was launched in June, 1919.

<h2 id="TUNSTILLS_CRAVEN_LEGION">TUNSTILL’S “CRAVEN LEGION.”</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/o.jpg" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> of the outstanding features of recruiting in Craven
in the early days of the war was a unique and entirely
successful effort by Mr. H. G. Tunstill, of Otterburn,
who at that time represented the Settle district
on the West Riding County Council.</p>

<p>Mr. Tunstill arrived home from Russia on August 20th,
1914, and very shortly afterwards issued a stirring appeal for
ninety-nine men to join him in making a company of one hundred
for enlistment in Lord Kitchener’s army. The appeal was
addressed more particularly to Mr. Tunstill’s constituents in the
neighbourhood of Settle, and a series of meetings were arranged.
At many of these enthusiastic scenes were witnessed, and after
a campaign extending from the 7th to the 18th of September
close upon one hundred men had been obtained, and they
paraded at Settle on the 19th. After going through the usual
attestation formalities they were royally entertained at the
Ashfield and Golden Lion Hotels, Mr. W. Morrison presiding
at the former place, and Mr. W. Simpson, Catteral Hall, at the
latter. Subsequently there was an entertainment at the Victoria
Hall where clothing, comforts and fruit were distributed.</p>

<p>The men left for their depot at Halifax amid memorable
scenes. They assembled in Settle Market Place at 7 a.m.,
and, after a parting speech by Mr. Morrison, were marched to
the station headed by the Brass Band and accompanied by a
large crowd. The train steamed out of the station amid cheering,
the detonation of fog signals and much waving of handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>At Silsden, Mr. Tunstill’s men were met by another batch
of recruits and marched into Keighley. It was something in
the nature of a triumphal progress, followed by an inspection
on the Town Hall Square by the Mayor (Mr. W. A. Brigg) and
other local gentlemen. They departed for Halifax in the afternoon
by special train and were inspected by Col. Thorold, the
officer commanding the depot, who publicly thanked Mr.
Tunstill for his services in obtaining such a fine body of men.
Two days later they were drafted to Frensham, near Aldershot,
and ultimately became “A” Company of the 10th Battalion
Duke of Wellington’s Regiment. Then followed a period of
rigorous training in which the men acquitted themselves very
creditably.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Tunstill had been offered and accepted a
commission and was gazetted Captain in November, 1914. The
Battalion went to France in August, 1915, and Captain Tunstill
remained with the Company until October, 1916, when he was
sent to England with a damaged knee and ankle. He became
unfit for active service, but performed valuable work in connection
with the training of recruits in England. He was mentioned
in dispatches in December, 1916. The Company saw much
fighting in France and also served with distinction in Italy.</p>

he loved Association football, and was identified for many years with the Ingleton Football Club as Captain,
in which capacity he frequently led his men to victory. At the invitation of the Bradford City Club he played with

The news of his death was received with very deep regret, for he had, by his geniality of disposition, earned the
affection of a wide circle of friends. The deceased officer, who was twenty-two years of age, was destined for
the legal profession, and had before him a career of much promise. The outbreak of war saw him, with typical
British patriotism, eager to take his part in the momentous struggle. He had joined the 6th Bn. Duke of
Wellington’s Regiment in 1913, and was gazetted 2nd Lieut. It was while training in camp at Marske that the
Territorial Force was ordered to mobilize, and he went with his Bn. to Immingham, where they went into training,
and accompanied them later to Healing, Riby and Doncaster. Later he accompanied his Battalion to France,
where he proved himself a thorough and capable officer. It was while acting as instructor to a school of bomb
throwing that he met his sad end, being killed by the premature explosion of a rifle grenade on May 30th, 1915.
Death was instantaneous, and the whole regiment sincerely grieved the loss of one who had made himself a
general favourite with both officers and men. As one of the officers, in communicating the painful news to his
parents, said, “He was an excellent soldier and a thorough sportsman. He had no fear, his only wish being to
serve his King and Country, for which he has given his life.”</p>

in a flying accident at Gosport, and the sad event cast a deep gloom over the Craven District, where the
family is well known and highly respected. Lieut. Morkill, who was attached to the East Lancashire
Regiment, went to the front in Sept. 1914, and was on active service continuously up to February, 1915. On
returning to England, he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as a probationer and qualified as an

Pilot’s Certificate at the Eastbourne Flying School. On June 22nd, he was ordered to make the flight from
Gosport to Shoreham and back. The machine was certified to be in perfect order. According to the
evidence at the inquest Lieut. Morkill was preparing to start on the return journey from Shoreham. The
engine was running satisfactorily, but a leak was observed in the oil cistern. After a new pipe had been
fitted the journey was commenced. When up about 200 feet, the engine missed once or twice and appeared
to stop, due, as was subsequently ascertained, to a mechanical fracture. The aeroplane came to the
ground and Lieut. Morkill was found to have been crushed by the wreckage. He died as the result of
his injuries in his 23rd year. He married in Sept. 1914, Ellen Mary, youngest daughter of the late Mr.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
